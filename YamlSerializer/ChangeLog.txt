Alpha release of YamlSerializer as 0.9.0.1

* Removed TODO's for reporting bugs in YAML spec that are done.
* Fixed assembly copyright.
* !!merge is supported. Fixed issue#2605.
* Read-only class-type member with no child members are omitted when 
  serializing. Fixed issue#2599.
* Culture for TypeConverter is set to be CultureInfo.InvariantCulture. 
  Fixed issue #2629.
* To fix Issue#2631
  * Field names and property names are always presented as simple texts.
  * When deserializing, we can not avoid the parser parses some spacial
    names to !!bool and !!null. Such non-text nodes are converted to
    texts at construction stage.
* To fix issue#2663
  * Hash code stored in a mapping node is now updated when the a key node's
    content is changed.
  * Hash code and equality became independent on the order of keys in a 
    mapping node.
  * A mapping node checks for duplicated keys every time the node content 
    is changed.
  * Test results are changed because some of them are dependent on the hash 
    key order.
* The current equality evaluation is too strict, probably needs some adjustment.
* NativeObject property was added to YamlScalar.
* YamlScalar's equality is evaluated by comparing NativeObject.
